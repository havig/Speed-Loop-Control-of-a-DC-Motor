# Speed-Loop-Control-of-a-DC-Motor

Disclaimer : The project code is a miniaturised version of the original.

The project is of controlling the speed of the shaft of a DC Motor.

The program takes in the input from the user, calculates the RPM and with the help of the transfer function of a DC motor, the speed is changed.

Feel Free to tweak,reuse or upgrade the code. Send me Pull requests so I can merge your code to this repository.
