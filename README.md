# Speed-Loop-Control-of-a-DC-Motor

The project is for controlling the speed of the shaft of a DC Motor.

The program takes in the input speed or the desired RPM from the user, calculates and asjusts the RPM with the help of the transfer function of a DC motor until the desired speed is reached.

Feel Free to tweak,reuse or upgrade the code. Send me Pull requests so I can merge your code to this repository.
